In my younger days, I discovered my strengths lay in the artistic realm—drawing, graphic editing, and animation. Designing was both enjoyable and challenging for me, especially when it came to tasks like determining the right sizing and placement of elements, selecting harmonious color combinations, and evaluating the final results. These creative processes brought me the most joy.

In 2008, I created my first website and was surprised by how much fun I had. This experience sparked my interest in web development. Although my college curriculum didn’t include courses on development, I was determined to teach myself everything I could about it. This passion eventually led to an exciting opportunity: my college professor invited me to join him for an On-the-Job Training (OJT) project. He tasked me with building a website for the school where he worked. I eagerly accepted, and that’s how my adventure in web development began.

Today, my primary focus is on building and creating frontend interfaces, ensuring websites are user-friendly and adaptive. My expertise lies in JavaScript, particularly ReactJS, and CSS—technologies that are highly relevant in modern development. Over the years, I’ve worked on several projects using these tools, and I’ve grown confident in my abilities. I genuinely love what I do, and my passion motivates me to deliver successful projects.

Outside of work, I enjoy watching Japanese anime, catching basketball games, gardening in my backyard, and spending quality time with my wife. These activities help me recharge and fuel my creativity for coding.
