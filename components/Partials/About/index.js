            In my young days, my strengths lie in the artistic side; drawing, graphic
            editing, and animation. Designing for me is quite fun and challenging, stuff like
            deciding the proper sizing and placement of the element, setting the correct
            combination of colors, and judging the end result, those are the things
            that I enjoyed most. In 2008, I made my first website and I never thought
            that it was quite fun, and so that triggered my interest in web
            development. My college school doesn’t teach us about development but I
            thrive to learn more anything about it. Because of this interest, I landed
            an invitation for an OJT (On the Job Training), my college professor asked
            me to work for him for this OJT to build a website for the school where
            he’s working, and so I happily accepted it and that’s how my adventure in web
            development started.

            My main focus these days is building and creating frontend
            interfaces, ensuring that the website is easy to use, and adaptive.
            My skills are centered on Javascript specifically in ReactJS and CSS
            which is the trend nowadays. I made several projects with these
            technologies and I have become confident using these things. I love
            what I do, and my passion drives me towards successful projects.

            Outside of my work desk, I’m usually watching Japanese anime,
            watching basketball, gardening in the backyard, and hanging out with
            my wife, these are all ways for me to recharge and continue my coding.
